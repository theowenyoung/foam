### Wiki Link to Markdown Link

## Motivation

Inspired by Obsidian, but I'm not used to Obsidian, and how it's a bit slow compared to VSCode. I use Standard Markdown Style, I like foam wiki link autocompletion & create notes from a template, I can not find another extension that can be used, so I decided to fork it and only enable these two features. [Foam's](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) code structure is very good, so I just changed a little bit to achieve what I wanted. Thanks Foam Team!
